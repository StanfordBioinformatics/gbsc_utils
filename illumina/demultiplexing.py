	The software versions dependencies given below are copied from the v2.17 UG.

	The following software is required to run bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v2.17:
		1) zlib
		2) librt
		3) libpthread
	To build bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v2.17, you need the following software. Versions listed are tested and supported; newer versions are untested.
		1) gcc 4.7 (with support for c++11)
		2) boost 1.54 (with its dependencies) } CMake 2.8.9
		3) zlib
		4) librt
		5) libpthread
	Changes in bcl2fastq v2x:
		1) The binary name is bcl2fastq instead of configureBclToFastq.pl.
		2) Demultiplexes with 1mm by default. Can go upto 2 mm.
		3) By default, reads are output in the BaseCalls directory.
	  4) If a project is specified, a project subdirectory is created, and that subdirectory is named exactely as it appears in the SampleSheet.
		5) As stated in the bcl2fastq 2.1 UG: For each sample, there is one file per lane per read number (if reads exist for that sample, lane, and read number).
		6) The last part of the file name (before the .fastq.gz_ is _001. 
		7) By default, the SampleSheet.csv file will be searched for in the top-level run directory.
		8) As the UG puts it: --runfolder-dir is the current directory and --output-dir is the Data/Intensities/BaseCalls subdirectory of the run folder.
		   With this structure, the bcl2fastq command can be issued from the run-folder
		9) There isn't a --no-eamss option anymore.
		10) There isn't a NoIndex sample for unmultiplexed runs (sample sheet w/o entries) as there is with V1.
		11) It's multithreaded
		12) FASTQ header format is now 
					@<instrument>:<run number>:<flowcell ID>:<lane>:<tile>:<x- pos>:<y-pos>:<UMI> <read>:<is filtered>:<control number>:<index>
				In v1.8.4 it was:
					@<instrument>:<run number>:<flowcell ID>:<lane>:<tile>:<x- pos>:<y-pos> <read>:<is filtered>:<control number>:<index>
				
		The difference is the presence of the <UMI> tag in v2x. UMI stands for Unique Molecular Identifier. The UG states:
			UMIs are random k-mers attached to the genomic DNA before PCR amplification. The UMI is amplified with the amplicons, which 
			later allows for detection of PCR duplicates and correction of amplification errors. bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v2.17 
			removes these bases and places them into the read name in the FASTQ files.
